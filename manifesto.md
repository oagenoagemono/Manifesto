# Better Customer, Better Service, Better Life
> Our mission as staff is to end all unreasonable and unjust actions towards staff and the resulting consequence of a reduced QOL for both staff and customers.

We believe that no person should endure needless pain for the purpose of survival. From the staff stocking cans to the parent concerned about the safety of their child, we are all trying our best to thrive in this capitalistic society still filled with discrimination and prejudice in addition to a world-wide pandemic. While we acknowledge that times can be hard for anyone, we also believe that by having better care for each other, we can achive a better life for all people. We aim to achieve this goal of mutual betterment by the following actions:

## 1. Put Away Baskets and Carts in Designated Areas

We understand that you may have purchased a load of items with a car parked so far from the exit or a long walk to a bus station. Yet, when baskets and carts are misplaced, it becomes a nightmare for the staff who have to organize and keep track of store equipment. It may have been a 10 minute walk from the store to the bus stop, but it is an hour-long search for us-- **we are not omniscent robots, we are humans**. With our limited resources, cart and basket shortages ususally will not be addressed, leading to fewer carts and baskets, more frequent shortages, and an incovenient shopping trip. If you don't know where to put it, just hand it to the staff nearby.

## 2. Don't Leave Food Behind

Bringing food into the store, while in most cases is not a welcomed act, is a permissible one. However, that does not mean that you can leave a Starbucks cup with melted ice on a shelf.  
* We have no way of knowing that you left that there
* It becomes a seriously uncomfortable act picking it up and throwing it away (especially when sanitation is crucial for stopping a pandemic)
* We cannot take responsibility if a child consumes it
* It takes an extra effort to clean the floor when drinks spill
* Food crumbs can cause insects to roam free

What was a careless disposal can cause health hazards for staff and customers alike. Use appropriate methods to throw away trash in a trash can nearby.

## 3. Avoid Using Coins in Busy Times

We recognize that there are times when you want to get rid of pennies and nickels that are becoming weights in your wallet. We gladly accept coins in purchases. That does not mean that we don't detest customers that bring _only_ pennies and nickels for a purchase when there are people waiting in line. Having to count a bag of coins will slow down the line and forces other customers to bear through that time. Use card, include paper money, and/or make a purchase when the cashier is not busy.

## 4. Be Conscious of the Time

Although we are grateful that you decided to make a purchase, most stores do have a closing hour. Making a purchase of a cart of 60 items at the time of closing is _technically_ valid, but that does not mean that it is not despised. The closing hour is not when we stop working. We still have things to do after closing, and with a delayed purchase is a delayed time home. We do not want to be angry towards customers. Make a purchase earlier or _at least_ listen to staff warning you about the closing hour.

## 5. Don't Ask Questions to Off-time Staff

We know that navigating around the store can be difficult, and we are definitely available when you need insight on where a product is located. But that is only when we are working. Even if you know that a staff was working, if they do not have something that signifies that they are working (e.g. aprons, name tags, uniforms), then **please leave them alone**. They have a life after they are done working for the day, and asking them to work for you when they are not working is asking for free labor. We are paid to be staff. Please do not take an advantage of the fact that we are staff and require us to work for free. 

## 6. Don't Leave Items in Random Places

We understand that there are times when you rethink about what you were going to purchase, and that is totally fine. However, that does not mean that you should put items in a random place. Having to pick up random items off of the shelf and putting it back takes time out of our limited hours, and can lead to customers not being able to find a product they were looking for. If the item is a food item, then it can become a FDA regulation violation and cause the store to not be able to sell food. If it is a crucible, it can break and cause shards to spread everywhere, making it dangerous for staff and customers. If you know where the item goes, it would be nice if you could put it back in the correct spot, and even if you do not know where it goes, just hand it to staff. Not having to find things hidden in the shelves helps _a lot_.

## 7. Staff are _NOT_ Omniscent

Staff do know more about the store than customers, but that does not mean that we know all about everything. We can't read you mind on whether you want a bag. We may not know that an item just got sold out. We cannot magically add more of the item that you want. We only have what we have, and we have limited powers to maintain the store. All customers have different preferences-- you may want a bag to be under a certain weight and not care about the price of the bag, but another customer would hate it if we added a paper bag to fit 20 items. We can only act in a way that would satisfy customers in a general way. Please be aware that we staff are also humans. We are not perfect, just like you aren't.

We may be asking a lot out of you. There may be times that you are not able to accomplish all actions, and that is fine. Just like we are humans, we know that you are a human trying to thrive. But just know that if you follow these guidelines, we can accomplish more things. We can stock more items, we can help more customers, and most importantly, we can provide better quality service in a positive mood. 

> By mutual care, we can accomplish more.  
> We can thrive longer.  
> We can be happier.  
> **We can create a better world for all of us.**
